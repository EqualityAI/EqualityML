Title: Algorithms for Evaluating Fairness Metrics and Mitigating Unfairness in Supervised Machine Learning
Description: Equality AI (EAI) is a public benefit corporation dedicated to providing developers with the tools to stop
  algorithmic bias. We believe that developers want to implement algorithmic fairness, but have encountered roadblocks
  along the way.
  We provide a set of tools to handle the fairness of a Machine Learning application or run Fairness-based machine
  learning. With the increased use of Machine Learning solutions on a variety of critical real-world problems,
  it is imperative to guarantee that fair decisions are performed by those black-box Machine Learning models.
