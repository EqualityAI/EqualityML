Title: Algorithms for evaluating fairness metrics and mitigating unfairness in supervised machine learning
Description: Equality AI (EAI) is a public benefit corporation dedicated to providing developers with the tools to stop
  algorithmic bias. We believe that developers want to implement algorithmic fairness, but have encountered roadblocks
  along the way.
  FairML provides a set of tools to handle the fairness of a Machine Learning application or run Fairness-based machine
  learning (Fair ML). With the increased use of Machine Learning solutions on a variety of critical real-world problems,
  it is imperative to guarantee that fair decisions are performed by those black-box Machine Learning models. FairML aims
  to simplify the complex process of evaluating the fairness of ML models and provides a range of methods to mitigate bias
  in datasets.
