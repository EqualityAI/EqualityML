## Let's start with a Welcome and a HUGE thank you!

We at Equality AI (EAI) really appreciate the fact that you are here. 

We are working to reduce or elimiate bias from healthcare decision making. This is not an easy task but a crucial one to ensuire health equity for all people. Without the support of our community this task would be virtually impossible. We rely on awesome people like you to help us make health equity a reality. So, a hearty **THANK YOU** from all of us at Equality AI! 

If you haven't already, please check out the [Equality AI Manifesto!](https://github.com/EqualityAI/responsible_mlops/blob/main/MANIFESTO.md) Our Manifesto provides insight into how we operate as an organization, our responsibilities, and our commitments to AI for Good, AI that is Fair, and AI for Equity.

## Using the issue tracker


The [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/EqualityAI/responsible_mlops/issues) is the preferred channel for bug reports. (See definition of a bug below :grin: :lady_beetle: )

* Have a question about the EAI code? Please check out the [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/EqualityAI/responsible_mlops/discussions)  first to see if your question has already been asked or answered.  GitHub discussions are the preferred way to ask support questions, but we do also use [Slack #support channel(https://equalityai.slack.com/archives/C03HF7G4N0Y)! 


## Bug reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository.
Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been
   reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the
   latest `main` or `next` branch in the repository.

3. **Isolate the problem** &mdash; ideally create a reduced test case.

Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is
your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What OS experiences the
problem? What would you expect to be the outcome? All these details will help
people to fix any potential bugs.

Example:

> Short and descriptive example bug report title
>
> A summary of the issue and the browser/OS environment in which it occurs. If
> suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.
>
> 1. This is the first step
> 2. This is the second step
> 3. Further steps, etc.
>
> `<url>` - a link to the reduced test case
>
> Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being
> reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as
> causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their
> merits).

## Security concerns 
If you uncover a security vulnerability in EAI code, please do not report it in the public issue tracker. Instead, disclose responsibly by letting [the Equality AI team](mailto:support@equalityai.com?subject=Security) know upfront. We will assess the issue as soon as possible and will give you an estimate for when we have a fix and release available.

## Feature requests

We'd love to hear how we can improve the code with new features! What pain points are you experiencing in adopting these tools? How can we help? Are there use cases you would like to see? Methods we should add? Feature requests recommend new functionality, or improved functionality. Please keep in mind they are different than bug reports. 

Feature requests should be posted in the [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/EqualityAI/ResponsibleMLOpsToolkit/discussions). This will allow good conversation to take place between community members so the whole community can participate. Users will also be able to "upvote" feature requests that they would like to see, so partipations in the discussions helps the community to determine which features are the most important!

Please provide as much detail and context as possible and remember to follow the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/EqualityAI/ResponsibleMLOpsToolkit/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Pull requests

Good pull requests - patches, improvements, new features - are a fantastic
help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated
commits.

### For Contributors

If you have never created a pull request before, welcome :tada: :smile:! Don't worry, everyone was a beginner at some point and there are lots of resources to get your started. [Here is a great tutorial](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github) on how to create a pull request. Or, you can check out this [tutorial](http://www.firsttimersonly.com/) as well! 

1. [Fork](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/) the project, clone your fork,
   and configure the remotes:

   ```bash
   # Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>
   # Navigate to the newly cloned directory
   cd <repo-name>
   # Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/EqualityAI/<repo-name>
   ```

2. If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull upstream main
   ```

3. Create a new topic branch (off the main project development branch) to
   contain your feature, change, or fix:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
   ```

4. Make sure to update, or add to the tests when appropriate. Patches and
   features will not be accepted without tests. Run `npm test` to check that
   all tests pass after you've made changes. Look for a `Testing` section in
   the projectâ€™s README for more information.

5. If you added or changed a feature, make sure to document it accordingly in
   the `README.md` file.

6. Push your topic branch up to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin <topic-branch-name>
   ```

7. [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)
    with a clear title and description.

8. One of the Equality AI Maintainers will review your request and either commit it to the Main Branch or reach out to you for more information when needed. 

## Reach out for help!
