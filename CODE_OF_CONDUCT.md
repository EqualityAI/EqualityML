# Equality AI Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

The [Equality AI Manifesto][manifesto] guides all of our interactions, on GitHub, Slack, and any other means of communication. 

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
Equality AI community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best for the community 
* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, such as GitHub and Slack, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.  The Code of Conduct also applies to any events associated with the Equality AI project, both in-person and virtual.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the Equality AI team at contact@equalityai.com.  
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The Equality AI core team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.
