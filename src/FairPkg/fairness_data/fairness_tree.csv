1,N,,,2,Yes/No,Does your algorithm use an individual's sensitive variable information (intentional discrimination) to make a decision?,"For example, do you use a person's gender to make the decision?",
1,Y,,,3,Yes/No,Does your algorithm use an individual's sensitive variable information (intentional discrimination) to make a decision?,"For example, do you use a person's gender to make the decision?",
2,Y,,1,12,Yes/No,"Do you want to assess if your population is disadvantaged by multiple sources of discrimination such as race, class, gender, religion, and other inner traits?","For example, multiple sources would include accounting for all of a patient's attributes such as their gender, their age, etc... when measuring fairness",
2,N,,1,4,Yes/No,"Do you want to assess if your population is disadvantaged by multiple sources of discrimination such as race, class, gender, religion, and other inner traits?","For example, multiple sources would include accounting for all of a patient's attributes such as their gender, their age, etc... when measuring fairness",
3,Y,,1,9999999,Yes/No,Are any discrepancies between the groups of your sensitive variable explained away by explanatory variables that are correlated with the sensitive attribute in a legitimate way?,"For instance, a discrepancy in female and male job hiring rates is explained by their education levels.",
4,Y,,2,20,Yes/No,Are there any standards or regulations enforced to avoid discrimination with regard to the decision being made?,An example standard would be an internal organizational policy imposing diversity among employees such as hiring equally from sensitive variable groups.,
4,N,,2,11,Yes/No,Are there any standards or regulations enforced to avoid discrimination with regard to the decision being made?,An example standard would be an internal organizational policy imposing diversity among employees such as hiring equally from sensitive variable groups.,
11,Y,,4,22,Yes/No,Is there a reliable label or ground truth for the outcome of interest? Is there no historical or measurement bias?,An example of areas where ground truths are available are disease prediction or hospital readmission. There is no ground truth when predicting whether a job  applicant is hired or college admission since the outcome in the training data is inferred by a human decision maker (subjective). Historical bias occurs when the data legitimately collected over time leads to unwanted outcomes and measurement biases occurs when features or labels are not measured accurately. ,

12,Y,,2,18,Yes/No,Are you able to compare any pair of individuals in your dataset using a consistent metric based on their attributes?,"An example of not having a metric would be if a company is hiring 2 out of 3 applicants and the company did not carefully define a way to rank applicants.  If you can assign a score to each individual based on their attributes, you can calculate the distance between them",
21,Y,,11,29,Yes/No,Do you have features/explanatory variables in your data that provide information about the outcome variable while at the same time are correlated with the sensitive variable?              ,"For example, a person's height may be an effective predictor for whether they can receive a kidney from a donor but also can be highly correlated with gender.",

22,Both,,11,36,Recall/Precision/Both,"Would you rather your algorithm catches positive cases at a high rate (recall), or is it more important for you to feel confident that you have a positive case if your algorithm predicts a positive (precision)?",,

23,Fixed,,22,26,Floating/Fixed,"If your model returns a probability for the positive outcome, will there be floating thresholds selected and fine-tuned by practitioners which accommodate  a changing context or will a fixed/single threshold be chosen that is valid for different use cases? ","Most public health prediction tools will use a fixed threshold. A potential floating threshold could be if a provider turns the decision over to the patient,  e.g., there is a 10% chance that a certain treatment regime will prolong life. A patient or provider may have different thresholds for risk they're willing to take. ",
